/// Indicates that a field is unsafe to write to, since we have to uphold certain invariants.

///
/// # Safety
/// - **Declaring** this struct is unsafe.
/// - within a struct, all fields should have a different associated constant, I would suggest just
///   numbering them from 0.
///
/// ```rs
/// type Boolean = u8;
/// let mut valid_bool = unsafe { UnsafeField::new(true as Boolean) };
/// let mut always_3 = unsafe { UnsafeField::new(3) };
/// // UB
/// mem::swap(valid_bool, always_3);
/// ```
///
/// # Theoretical Best Implementation
///
/// A better implementation of this is not possible without a macro. I would consider a macro
/// implementation a good enough proof for item-only scoping being possible all the time. This is
/// perhaps a bad name, but item-only scoping, means that we can write (all?) unsafe code to be
/// verifiably sound at item-scope, this includes
///
/// - Struct declaration
/// - Struct construction
/// - Function declaration
/// - Function calling
///
/// For example, in the case of `LongString`, the following declaration is unsound. This is is
/// because the type `usize` does not follow the same contract as the field `len`, therefore it is
/// and unsafe type to use for `len`. As a result, we must mark it as such. The same is the case
/// for all other fields, since they all have invariants.
///
/// ```rs
/// /// # Safety
/// /// - `len` must be constrained by [len invariants] at all times
/// /// - `capacity` must be contrained by [capacity invariants] at all times
/// /// - `buf` must constrained by [buf invaraiants] at all times
/// struct LongString {
///     len: usize,
///     capacity: usize,
///     buf: RawBuf<usize>,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Our declaration should soundly look like this:
///
/// ```rs
/// struct LongString {
///     unsafe len: usize,
///     unsafe capacity: usize,
///     unsafe buf: RawBuf<usize>,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// More formally, the encapsulation of struct-declaration unsafe scoping is as follows:
/// - A safety contract must be written above the struct declaration
/// - The safety contract must include **only** the invariants for each type. These invariants
///   should ideally be upheld *at all times*. I would suggest *always*, but this might not allow
///   for all possible data structures... I have a hunch it is though.
/// - If a field has an invariant that is already encapsulated safely by the type it is assigned,
///   we do not need to write about that invariant (though you can if you want??)
/// - If a field has an invariant that is not encapsulated safely by the type it is assigned, you
///   MUST declare it as `unsafe`.
///
/// It is potentially not obvious why this is encapsulated at the item level. Consider
/// function-execution unsafe scoping. The function defines a contract, and if we fulfill that
/// contract, we can execute the function *completely safely*. Generally,
///
/// 1. Define a contract for an unsafe item, such that
/// 2. if we validate that contract
/// 3. we can use the item safely
///
/// With struct-declaration unsafe scoping, we are doing essentially the same thing:
///
/// 1. Define a contract (for an unsafe item?) such that
/// 2. if we validate that contract (define the struct properly)
/// 3. we can use the item safely (define methods on the struct etc.)
///
/// The bit "for an unsafe item" might cause some disagreement. Who's to say that something is an
/// unsafe item? Well, in this world all struct declarations are unsafe, except for those without
/// a safety contract... Actually, that's the same as all functions in this world. All functions
/// are unsafe, except for those without a safety contract.
